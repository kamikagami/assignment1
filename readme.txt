I get the reference from blackboard example like getString() and getInt()
and make some slight changes.

For randomise the colour, since it is a little bit hard to randomise 
between 0 and 1,
I decided to make it random the number between 1 to 10, and set 5 as 
the random point(I don't know if this is a real word though), which means
the number between 1-5 will get the WHITE colour and the number between 
6-10 will get the RED colour.
